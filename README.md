# Joy Nine Men's Morris

Joy Nine Men's Morris is a very old intellectual game！

HOW TO PLAY？

PLACE ALL YOUR PIECES (MEN) ON BOARD AND MOVE THEM TO FORM A LINE OF 3 PIECES (A MILL).

ONCE YOU FORM A MILL, YOU CAN REMOVE ONE OF YOUR OPPONENT'S MEN. BREAK A MILL TO UNLOCK THE MILLS AGAIN.

PIECES FROM A FORMED MILL CAN'T BE REMOVED UNLESS NO OTHER MEN ARE AVAILABLE.

YOUR AIM IS TO LEAVE YOUR OPPONENT WITH EITHER 2 PIECES OR 0 MOVES!
